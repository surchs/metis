# Metis
_Tools for data handling and processing_

The Metis toolbox is a collection of functions to facilitate recurring tasks in my current projects. As it may prove useful to others, I make it openly available.

Expect things to change often and in ungraceful ways.

## Getting started
1. Clone this git repository
2. From inside the cloned directory, call
`python setup.py install`
3. Check out the [tutorial]('./doc/data_tutorial.html')
